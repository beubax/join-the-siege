The new internal IT policy update addresses crucial aspects of cybersecurity and remote work practices. With a growing workforce operating remotely, there is an increased emphasis on safeguarding digital assets against cyber threats. Employees must utilize company-approved VPNs and adhere to security protocols when accessing sensitive data. The policy also introduces a bi-annual password reset requirement and enhanced multi-factor authentication to bolster account security. IT support will provide a webinar on best practices for secure home networks, and all departments are encouraged to participate actively. This update underscores our commitment to fostering a secure digital workplace in an era of remote connectivity.
