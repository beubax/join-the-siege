This memorandum is intended to communicate updates on the recent Health Information Privacy Act amendments, which were ratified on June 10, 2023. Healthcare institutions are now mandated to implement enhanced encryption methodologies for patient data storage and transmission. Compliance with these updated standards is required by January 1, 2024, and failure to comply will result in penalties, including substantial fines and potential suspension of licenses. It is imperative that our IT and legal compliance teams collaborate effectively to ensure timely adherence to the new regulatory framework. Training sessions will be scheduled for all staff to familiarize them with the amended regulations and requisite procedures.
