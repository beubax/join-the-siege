Abstract: The Effects of a New Drug on Hypertension: A Randomized Control Trial. The study investigates the efficacy of the novel drug HTN-X in lowering blood pressure among patients with Grade 1 hypertension. This double-blind study involved 200 participants aged 30-60, randomly assigned to receive either HTN-X or a placebo for a period of 12 weeks. Results indicate a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the HTN-X group compared to the placebo, with mean reductions of 15.4 mmHg and 9.2 mmHg, respectively. Side effects were minimal, with headache being the most common complaint. These findings suggest HTN-X as a promising treatment for hypertension.
