Subject: Wellness Workshop Announcement

Dear Team,

In our quest to foster a healthy workplace environment, we are organizing a wellness workshop scheduled for next Thursday, from 10 AM to 12 PM in the conference hall. The session will be led by renowned wellness coach, Dr. Lina Carter, and will cover stress management techniques, nutrition tips, and exercises you can do at your desk.

Participation is voluntary, but we highly encourage everyone to attend, as prioritizing your well-being is essential not only for personal benefit but also for cultivating a more productive work atmosphere.

Please RSVP by Friday to help us make the necessary arrangements.

Best,

Human Resources Team
