This internal memo aims to update all team members on the newly implemented data protection policies. In compliance with GDPR, our organization has introduced stringent measures to safeguard personal data across all our platforms. Employees are required to complete mandatory data protection training by the end of this quarter, and to regularly update the secure handling practices. Any breaches of data security must be reported immediately using the incident report form on the intranet. Our commitment to maintaining confidentiality and integrity is paramount, and adherence to these procedures is non-negotiable.
