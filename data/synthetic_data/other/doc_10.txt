Internal Memo: Coffee Machine Maintenance

To: All Staff

This is to inform everyone that regular maintenance of the office coffee machines will be conducted this Friday between 12 PM and 2 PM. During this time, machines will be temporarily unavailable.

We suggest planning your coffee breaks accordingly. Alternatively, the kitchen on the second floor will remain operational, and complimentary coffee packets are available there for manual brewing.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Keeping our equipment in good working order ensures we can all enjoy our favorite beverages throughout the workday.

Best regards,

Facilities Management
