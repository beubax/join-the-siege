Dear Mr. Thompson,

Following our recent consultation, I am pleased to offer some tailored financial advice to optimize your investment portfolio. Diversification is key, and I recommend increasing exposure to international equities, particularly in emerging markets, which are poised for significant growth. Given your risk appetite, incorporating some high-yield bonds may offer stable returns while mitigating risk. Additionally, consider tax-efficient investment accounts to maximize your post-tax gains.
