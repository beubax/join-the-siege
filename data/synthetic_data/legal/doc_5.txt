To: Senior Researchers, Subject: Upcoming Research Funding Opportunities. As part of our strategic plan to enhance our research capabilities, we have identified several upcoming funding opportunities under the National Science Foundation. These opportunities focus on areas such as renewable energy technologies, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. Interested researchers are encouraged to attend the preparatory workshop on November 15, 2023, which will provide guidance on proposal writing and submission processes. We expect all submissions to align with the outlined institutional goals and demonstrate significant potential for impactful outcomes within the scientific community.
