To Whom It May Concern,

We are attempting to locate the owner of a small black leather wallet found in the lobby of the City Hall on October 1st. The wallet contains several business cards, a library membership card, and a few receipts but no identifying information.

If you believe this wallet may belong to you, please contact the City Hall front desk at your earliest convenience. We will require a description of the contents to ensure rightful ownership.

Thank you for your attention.
