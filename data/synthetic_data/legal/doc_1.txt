In the matter of Smith v. Johnson, the court convened to examine the core arguments pertaining to the breach of contract. The plaintiff, Ms. Smith, contends that Mr. Johnson failed to fulfill his obligations under the terms specified in their signed agreement dated March 15, 2021. The agreement clearly stipulated the completion of all contractual projects by December 31, 2021, which Mr. Johnson acknowledges was not achieved. The defendant argues that unforeseeable supply chain disruptions rendered it impossible to meet the deadline, thus seeking an extension under the force majeure clause embedded within the contract. The court is tasked with determining the applicability of said clause in light of present circumstances and prior case law.
