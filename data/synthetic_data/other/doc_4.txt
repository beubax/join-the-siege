Internship Reflection Report

During my internship with the City Planning Department, I had the opportunity to engage in various tasks that expanded my understanding of urban development. Throughout the four-month period, I participated in community meetings, contributed to zoning policy revisions, and assisted in drafting environmental impact assessments.

One of my most significant learning experiences was collaborating on the Sustainable Transportation Project. This involved working closely with seasoned planners and local stakeholders to design pedestrian-friendly routes, encouraging eco-friendly commuting.

Overall, this internship has greatly enriched my grasp of urban planning processes, policy implications, and the collaborative nature of government work. I am eager to apply these insights to my future academic and professional endeavors.
