Pursuant to the workplace equity enhancement initiative, this directive outlines the measures we are implementing to ensure a more inclusive environment. Steps include the establishment of an internal diversity council tasked with reviewing and recommending policy changes, increased support for affinity groups within the organization, and comprehensive training programs focused on unconscious bias and cultural competency. Additionally, performance metrics have been revised to include accountability for diversity-related outcomes. Our commitment to fostering an equitable workplace is unwavering, and ongoing feedback from employees will be a pivotal component of our strategy.
