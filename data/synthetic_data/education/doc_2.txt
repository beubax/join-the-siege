Research Paper Abstract: The Impact of Technology on Student Engagement

This study examines how technological tools can enhance student engagement in higher education classrooms. Data was collected from 300 university students over two semesters, utilizing surveys and focus group interviews.

Results indicate that interactive elements like online polls and discussion boards significantly increase student participation and retention of information. Technology facilitates real-time feedback, fostering an environment of active learning.

Further research is recommended to explore long-term impacts of specific technologies and to understand the varying effects on different demographic groups. Implications for educators include the integration of adaptable technological resources tailored to course objectives.
