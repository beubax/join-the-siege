Subject: Friendly Neighbor's Potluck

Hey Everyone,

I hope you're having a wonderful week! I'm excited to announce that we'll be hosting our annual neighborhood potluck this Saturday at Riverview Park from 1 PM to 4 PM. It's a great opportunity to catch up with old friends and welcome new faces to our community.

Please bring a dish to share. We already have commitments for some main courses, so side dishes, desserts, and beverages are very welcome. Let's make sure we have a little bit of everything!

Looking forward to a lovely afternoon filled with fun, food, and friendship.

Warmly,

Tom Richard
